# 🎓 Student Record Management App (MERN)

A simple and efficient **MERN stack** web application to manage student records with full **CRUD operations**. Built as part of an academic integration/engineering assignment focusing purely on core data management without authentication.

## ✨ Features

- ➕ Add students with:
  - `studentName`
  - `grade` (Dropdown: **O, A+, A, B+, B, C, RA**)
  - `subject`
- 📋 View all student records in a clean table layout
- ✏ Edit & update student details
- 🗑 Delete student records with confirmation dialog
- ⚡ Real-time UI updates using React state

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- **REST API** design using Express.js
- **Mongoose Schema & Models**
- Modular backend structure (controller, routes, config)
- Frontend routing using `react-router-dom`
- State management using `useState` & `useEffect`
- Axios for API communication
- No static placeholders or text nodes inside `<tr>` to avoid hydration errors
